RingsPy is a Voronoi diagrams-based geometric generation tool that generates 3D meshes and models of prismatic cellular solids with radial growth rules.

## Dependencies and Installation
RingsPy depends on mainstream Python libraries ``numpy`` and ``scipy``, and optionally depends on library ``hexalattice``, if the regular hexagonal lattice (e.g. honeycomb) is wanted; also ``vtk``, if the 3D STL files are also wanted.
### 1. pip install
To install RingsPy, one may use `pip`:
```bash
pip install ringspy
``` 
or use:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kingyin3613/RingsPy.git
``` 
to get updates beyond the latest release. 

### 2. conda install
If you are on Linux or Mac, you can also use `conda-forge` channel:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ringspy
``` 

### 3. Installation Check

There are some unit tests in [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/RingsPy/tree/main/tests/). One can use ``pytest`` to check whether the installation is successful by running this command:

```bash
pytest .
```

## Getting Started
Once all required components are installed and one is ready to begin, a path forward should be established for generating the mesh. The basic steps for running/viewing a cellular mesh are listed as the following:

    1. Edit geometry and algorithm parameters
    2. Generate mesh using Mesh Generation Tools
    3. Visualize 2D view using Matplotlib or 3D model in `ParaView`
    4. (Optional) Export 3D STL model for 3D editing and/or printing
	5. (Optional) Export input file for numerical simulations with software `Abaqus`

### 1. Geometry and Parameters
The first step to generate a cellular geometry is selecting geometry and appropriate parameters. 

### 1.1. Geometry
A template file, for example, `test_wood_cube.py` located in the [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/RingsPy/tree/main/tests/) directory acts as both the parameter input file, and main executable for the generation of a cubic wood specimen.

*Note: The Mesh Generation Tool by now only accepts many of pre-defined boundary geometries (for v0.3.x, the following 3 shapes are supported: triangle, square, hexagon), importing of CAD and/or other 3D model files will be implemented in subsequent versions.*

*Note: for greatest compatibility create the geometry using all millimeters.*

### 1.2. Parameters


By opening a input file, e.g., `tests/test_wood_cube.py` in any text editor, a file format similar to what is shown below will be displayed:
```
geoName = 'wood_cube'
path = 'meshes'

radial_growth_rule = 'wood_binary'
iter_max = 100
print_interval = 500

# Radial cell growth parameters
# length unit: mm
r_min = 0   # inner radius of wood log
r_max = 4   # outer radius of wood log
nrings = 4 # number of rings
width_heart = 0.3*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # heart wood ring width
width_early = 0.7*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # early wood ring width
width_late = 0.3*(r_max-r_min)/nrings # late wood ring width
log_center = (0,0) # coordinates of log center in the global system of reference

cellsize_early = 0.02
cellsize_late = 0.01
cellwallthickness_early = 0.010
cellwallthickness_late = 0.006
    
# clipping box parameters
boundaryFlag = 'on'
box_shape = 'square'
box_center = (1.25,0) # coordinates of box center in the global system of reference
box_size = 1.0 # side length
   
# longitudinal direction parameters
fiberlength = 0.5*box_size
theta_min = 0 # radian
theta_max = 0.05 # radian
z_min = 0
z_max = box_size
long_connector_ratio = 0.02 # longitudinal joint size
    
merge_operation = 'on'
merge_tol = 0.01
    
precrackFlag = 'off'
precrack_widths = 0.1
    
stlFlag = 'on'
    
inpFlag = 'on'
inpType = 'Abaqus'
```

- `geoName` is the geometry name, `path` is the folder where the mesh files will be generated.
- `radial_growth_rule` is the radial growth rule for cell placement. When a file name with extension`.npy` is specified, a saved cell data file will be loaded (for v0.3.x, choose one of these rules: `wood_binary`, `regular_hexagonal`, or a file name with extension `.npy`).
- `iter_max` is the max number of iteration for randomly placing new non-overlapping cell particles in the 2D toroidal cell placement region. Noticing that, larger `iter_max` leads to more centroidal Voronoi cells, for more reference, see Wiki [Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroidal_Voronoi_tessellation/).
- `print_interval` is the print interval when every n cell particles are placed in the placement region.
- `r_min` and `r_max` are the upper and lower bounds of radii of toroidal cell placement region, `nrings` is the number of rings.
- `width_heart`, `width_early`, and `width_late`, are ring widths for heartwood, earlywood, and latewood, respectively, which all together determine the morphology of the cellular structure.
- `log_center` is the location of the placement region.
- `cellsize_early`,`cellsize_late`, `cellwallthickness_early`, and `cellwallthickness_late` are parameters for the earlywood and latewood cells.
- `boundaryFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating neat boundaries consisting of grains.
- `box_shape` is the shape of cutting box (for v0.3.x, choose one of following shapes: `triangle`, `square`, or `hexagon`).
- `box_center`, and `box_size` are for locating the cutting box.
- `fiberlength` is the length of fibers consisting the prismatic cells during the z- (longitudinal) extrusion.
- `theta_min` and `theta_max` determine the twisting angles (unit: radian) of the 2D mesh around the `log_center` during the extrusion.
- `z_min` and `z_max` determine the range of prismatic cells in z- (longitudinal) direction.
- `long_connector_ratio` is the length of longitudinal joints, with `joint length = long_connector_ratio * fiberlength`.
- `merge_operation` flag can be turned on/off for the merging operation, when flag is on, cell ridges that are shorter than the threshold `merge_tol` in the 2D mesh will be deleted, and their vertices will be merged respectively, the mesh will be reconstructed. This is designed for eliminating small cell ridges/walls which fall out of the resolution range of the 3D printing and for avoiding having elements with too small stable time increments in numerical simulations. 
- `precrackFlag` flag is for inserting a pre-crack, for the notched specimens. So far, only a single line pre-crack with the length of `precrack_widths` is supported.
- `stlFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating 3D STL files.
- `inpFlag` flag can be turned on/off for generating input files for numerical simulations.
- `inpType` indicates the software(s) that the mesh generation should generate input files for.

### 2.1. Run Mesh Generation
Open a Command Prompt or Terminal window and set the current directory to [tests](https://github.com/kingyin3613/RingsPy/tree/main/tests/) or any other directory, then run the command:
```
    python test_wood_cube.py
```
Functions in `MeshGenTools` library will be called to create the initial mesh, wood cell particles following certain cell size distribution will be placed, then `Scipy.voronoi` function will be called to form the initial 2D Voronoi tessellation, additional code reforms the tesselation and generates the desired files. A successful generation will end with the line "Files generated ..." in the Terminal window.

A new folder should have been created in the `.\meshes` directory with the same name as the `geoName` in `test_wood_cube.py`.

### 2.2. Check Mesh and 3D Model Files

The following files should be generated in the `.\meshes\geoName` directory with a successful run:
- Mesh files
    - Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) beam file: `wood_cubeIGA.txt`
    - connector data file: `wood_cube-mesh.txt`
    - Grain-ridge data file: `wood_cube-vertex.mesh`
    - Ridge data file: `wood_cube-ridge.mesh`
- Visualization files
    - Cross-sectional image file for initial 2D configuration: `wood_cube.png`
    - Paraview vtk file for initial vertex configuration: `wood_cube_vertices.vtu`
    - Paraview vtk file for initial grain solid configuration: `wood_cube_beams.vtu`
    - Paraview vtk file of initial cell ridge configuration: `wood_cube_conns.vtu`
    - Paraview vtk file of initial connector (volume) configuration: `wood_cube_conns_vol.vtu`
- (Optional) 3D model files
    - STL file of initial cellular solid configuration: `wood_cube.stl`
- (Optional) Abaqus input files
    - INP file of simulation input of initial cellular solid configuration in `Abaqus`: `wood_cube.inp`
	
### 3. Visualization
A scientific visualization application `ParaView` can directly visualize the generated vtk files; It can also visualize generated 3D model STL files if the STL flag is on. `Paraview` is a free software, it can be downloaded from its official website: [https://www.paraview.org/download/](https://www.paraview.org/download/), latest version is recommeded.

### 4. (Optional) Numerical Simulation
The mesh generation tool can also prepare the input files for the numerical simulations of the cellular solid in other softwares. By now (version 0.3.0), the input file format, `.inp`, that is used in a finite element method (FEM) software `Abaqus` is supported, if the INP flag is on. `Abaqus` is a commerical software suite for integrated computer-aided engineering (CAE) and finite element analysis, own by Dassault Systèmes. One may refer to its [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaqus) for more about `Abaqus`, and to [Introduction](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/files/bertoldi/files/abaqusinputfilemanualv1.pdf?m=1444417191) for the introduction of Abaqus input files.

All steps for the model setup can be accomplished through manually coding the Abaqus input file in a text editor. The method used in the example procedure shown below requires access to the Abaqus GUI.

### 4.1 Create New Model
    1. Open Abaqus CAE
    2. Create a new model
        -	File > New Model Database > With Standard/Explicit Model

### 4.2 Import Meshed Part

    1. Import the meshed part
        - File > Import > Part
        - Select the newly created file which ends in `.inp` (note: you may need to change the File Filter to see this file)
        - Click OK
    2. Rename part
        - Under the model tree (left) expand `Parts`
        - Right click on the part > Rename...
        - Enter a new name less than 14 characters, no special symbols, and easily recognizable (i.e. "WoodCube")

*Note: if FEM parts will be added to the model, this RingsPy generated part must come first alphabetically. Also recommended not to include numbers in the name.*
